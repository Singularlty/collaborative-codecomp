# collaborative-codecomp

Purpose: 
A respository of solutions to hopefully benefit those of Herricks Coding Club; holds the solutions and progress of studying competitive coding. Goals are mostly passing usaco bronze/silver in addition to just gaining experience.

About:
Repository for me and max's codeforces solutions. Within the CodeforcesBLadder folder there should be 2 additional folders - one of my solutions (in java) and one of max's (in c++). 
The approaches we take should be fairly similar; only differences are the language (but max's is typically cleaner and argubaly better lol).

Going to try to include documentation when time allows.
